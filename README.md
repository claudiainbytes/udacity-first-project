## Reflections

You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:

  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

** What new skills have you learned? **

I knew about HTML but in its 4th version. Right now, I can say my HTML skills were updated to the latest one, the 5th version. New tags were added, other tags and attributes were deprecated. Understanding the use of HTML5 structures is useful, I didn't have idea
the difference between <i> tag and <em> tag or <b> tag and <strong> tag. Tags are useful depends on their context or purpose.

** What has been easy? **

In my opinion, indexating all the HTML5 structure has been easy to learn. It's a good practice to stay organized for a comprensible code, no matter what the programming language.

** What has been difficult? **

Sometimes there are tags that work as parents and child elements where nesting or grouping elements are important. But in some tags like <section>, <article>, <header> and <footer> are confusing.

** How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far **

Of course I do. Reading first, then practice. When I practice an exercise I think and write down the ideas on paper. Then, I code the idea, try and check if everything is OK. In case of failure, I review my code, search on StackOverFlow to resolve the mistake. This is a constant process until you project looks like that I, you or someone else wanted.
